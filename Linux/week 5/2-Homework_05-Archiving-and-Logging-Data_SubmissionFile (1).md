### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:

tar xvvf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
tar cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude="TarDocs/Documents/Java" TarDocs/

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
tar -tvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:
sudo tar --listed-incremental=snapshot.file -cvzf logs_backup.tar.gz /var/log

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same with `tar`?
Option '-x' is used to extract a compressed file thats has been already created and option '-c' is used to create a compressed file. You can't do both of them in the same command.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
0 6 * * */3 tar -zcf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
sudo mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

#!/bin/bash

free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt 
df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
chmod +x system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
cat ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
cat ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
cat ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
cat ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:
sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.weekly

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

/var/log/auth.log {
    weekly
    rotate 7
    notifempty
    delaycompression
    missingok
}

---

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:
systemctl status auditd

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:
sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

max_log = 35
num_logs = 7

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:
sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

-w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit
-w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit
-w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit


4. Command to restart `auditd`:
sudo systemctl restart auditd

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:
sudo auditctl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report:
sudo aureport -au

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:
sudo useradd attacker
sudo aureport -m

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:

sudo auditctl -l
---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

sudo journalctl -b -p emerg..err
1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:
sudo journalctl -b -u systemd-journald | less
1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:
sudo journalctl --vacuum-file=2


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:
sudo journalctl -p 0..2> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:


@daily journalctl -p 0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
